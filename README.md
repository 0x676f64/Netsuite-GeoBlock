# Netsuite-GeoBlock

A comprehensive NetSuite Website Geographic Access Control solution, specifically targeting customer registration and online purchases to combat fraud and spam. It's built with multiple script types to provide layered protection:

1. Suitelet (Active and Detailed): This is the primary and currently active part of the code.

2. Client Script (Commented Out): A client-side validation that could provide immediate feedback.

3. User Event Script (Commented Out): A server-side validation on customer record creation.
