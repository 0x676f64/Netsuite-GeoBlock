üß© Deployment Instructions
üîπ Layer 1: Client Script
Use Case: Prevent form interaction for non-US users (frontend)
You have three options, depending on your site setup:

‚úÖ Option A: Inject into the theme (SuiteCommerce)
Go to Commerce > Website > Site Management Tools > Themes

Clone your theme if needed.

Edit your template file for registration, checkout, or wherever the form lives.

Add this line at the bottom of the page:

html
Copy
Edit
<script src="/SuiteScripts/GeoBlock_ClientScript.js"></script>
Upload GeoBlock_ClientScript.js to the File Cabinet under /SuiteScripts/

Deploy the theme.

‚úÖ Option B: Add as a SuiteCommerce Extension
This is ideal if you want to keep things modular and reusable:

Use NetSuite‚Äôs Extension Developer Tools

Create a simple extension with:

entryPoint.js that calls your logic

Manifest that loads it on pages you want

Upload and activate via Extensions Manager

‚úÖ Option C: Inject via SSP page
If you're using SiteBuilder or older SSP-based commerce:

Go to your registration/checkout SSP file

Insert:

html
Copy
Edit
<script src="/SuiteScripts/GeoBlock_ClientScript.js"></script>
Upload the JS to the File Cabinet

üîπ Layer 2: Suitelet Script
Use Case: Blocks the page before loading it for non-US IPs
Go to Customization > Scripting > Scripts > New

Choose Suitelet

Upload your Layer 2 script file (e.g., GeoBlock_Suitelet.js)

Save it, and it will auto-create the Script record

Set:

Status: Released

Log Level: Audit or Debug

Deploy it:

Go to the Deployments tab > click ‚ÄúNew Deployment‚Äù

Check ‚ÄúAvailable Without Login‚Äù

Give it a friendly URL (e.g., /GeoCheck)

Save and grab the external URL (e.g., /app/site/hosting/scriptlet.nl?script=123&deploy=1)

Update links to registration/checkout to go through this Suitelet first:

perl
Copy
Edit
https://[yourdomain]/app/site/hosting/scriptlet.nl?script=123&deploy=1&redirect_url=%2Fregister
üîπ Layer 3: User Event Script
Use Case: Hard block customer creation if record is invalid
Go to Customization > Scripting > Scripts > New

Select User Event

Upload your Layer 3 file (e.g., GeoBlock_CustomerUE.js)

Save it ‚Äì it will auto-create the script record

Under Deployments tab:

Click ‚ÄúNew Deployment‚Äù

Set Applies To = Customer

Check Create (only)

Status = Released

Save

Now it will automatically block suspicious records, regardless of how they‚Äôre submitted (forms, APIs, etc.).
